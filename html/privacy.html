          <p><strong>Last Updated on September 30th, 2016</strong></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how STRATIM Systems Incorporated and its subsidiaries STRATIM Enterprise Platform, Inc. and STRATIM Supplier Platform, Inc. (collectively, <strong>“STRATIM,” “we,”</strong> and <strong>“us”</strong>) collect, use, and share information about you when you use our mobile applications, our websites (including <a href="http://www.stratim.com/">www.stratim.com</a> and our other websites that are linked to our homepage), or our other products or services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites or applications that we do not operate or other websites that have their own privacy policies. By using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3 id="collection-of-personal-information">Collection of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>If you use our Services, we collect information that can be used to identify you, including your name, email address, postal address, phone number, credit card number, IP address, device location data, demographic information (such as your gender and occupation) as well as other information that you may provide to us (collectively, <strong>“Personal Information”</strong>).</p>
          <p>We operate proprietary technology and software that we call the <strong>“STRATIM Platform”</strong> that enables businesses to connect and contract with other businesses for services. To join the STRATIM Platform, either as a customer or as a service provider, we will require you to enter into separate agreements with us that describe your relationship to the STRATIM Platform and may require you to provide certain Personal Information and authorize us to share that Personal Information with third-parties beyond the scope of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>When you visit our Websites or use our applications, Personal Information about you and your device are collected, including your IP address, operating system, browser type, information about how you use our Websites, and other technical data that could be used to personally identify you.</p>
          <p>We may collect and store information about where you are located by accessing the GPS information available through your device. Location information may be collected as you use our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. We may collect this information for various purposes—including to provide you with customer support, to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services and for our internal business purposes.</p>
          <p>We collect certain information about the vehicles that are serviced by participants of the STRATIM Platform, including, without limitation, each vehicle’s make, model, model year, license plate number, and VIN, and we combine such vehicle information with other Personal Information we collect about you.</p>

We use both “session” cookies (that expire after each browser session) and “persistent” cookies (that remain on your device until you remove them). We use cookies to personalize our Services, to keep you logged into our Websites, to collect data about your use of our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage of our Services. We may engage with third-party service providers (including third-party advertisers) that may place their own cookies or mechanisms on your device when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any cookies or data collection tools that third-parties may place on your device. Third-parties, through the use of cookies and other mechanisms, may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites when you use our Services.</p>
