          <h2 id="terms-and-condition">TERMS AND CONDITION</h2>
          <p><strong>Last Updated on September 30th, 2016</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms and Conditions (the <strong>“Terms”</strong>) govern your use of services provided by STRATIM Systems Incorporated and its subsidiaries STRATIM Enterprise Platform, Inc. and STRATIM Supplier Platform, Inc. (collectively, <strong>“STRATIM,”</strong> <strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>). We operate proprietary technology and software that we call the “STRATIM Platform” that enables businesses to connect and contract with other businesses that provide services (collectively <strong>“Services”</strong>). The STRATIM Platform includes one or more mobile device applications (collectively, the <strong>“App”</strong>) and our websites, including <a href="#">www.stratim.com</a> (collectively, the <strong>“Website”</strong>).</p>
          <p>These Terms apply to all users and others who access or use the STRATIM Platform, whether on behalf of a company or on their own individual behalf, and independent contractors providing Services (collectively, <strong>“Users”</strong>).</p>
          <p><strong>Please read these Terms carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. By accepting these Terms, you are agreeing that disputes between you and STRATIM will be resolved by binding arbitration and you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong></p>
          <h3 id="agreement-to-terms">Agreement to Terms</h3>
          <p>By accessing the STRATIM Platform or using or providing Vehicle Services, as the case may be, each User agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the STRATIM Platform.</p>
          <h3 id="separate-agreements">Separate Agreements</h3>
          <p>To access most of the STRATIM Platform and to purchase or perform Services, Users may be asked to enter into separate agreements from time to time (collectively, <strong>“Separate Agreements”</strong>). If any provision of these Terms expressly conflicts with any provision of a Separate Agreement, the conflicting provision in the Separate Agreement will control and all other provisions in these Terms and each Separate Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <h3 id="changes-to-terms-and-conditions">Changes to Terms and Conditions</h3>
          <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the STRATIM Platform or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the STRATIM Platform after we have posted modified Terms on the STRATIM Platform, you are manifesting your intent to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can’t use the STRATIM Platform anymore. Because the STRATIM Platform will continue to evolve, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the STRATIM Platform or the Vehicle Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
          <h3 id="eligibility-to-use-the-stratim-platform">Eligibility to Use the STRATIM Platform</h3>
          <p>Users may use the STRATIM Platform only if they are (a) 18 years or older, (b) capable of forming a binding contract, and (c) not barred from using the STRATIM Platform under applicable law.</p>
          <h3 id="account">Account</h3>
          <p>If you want to access and use the STRATIM Platform, you may be required to create an account (<strong>“Account”</strong>). You can do this via the Website, the App or through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook (each, an <strong>“SNS Account”</strong>). If you choose the SNS Account option, we’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name, email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you do not maintain current information with us, we may have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>

          <p>NEITHER STRATIM, ITS AFFILIATES NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE STRATIM PLATFORM, SERVICES OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE STRATIM PLATFORM, SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT STRATIM, ITS AFFILIATES OR SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
          <p>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN, NEITHER STRATIM NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY THAT ARISES OUT OF OR RELATES TO ANY USER’S PROVISION OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S PROVISION OF SERVICES OR ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM THAT ARISES OUT OF OR RELATES TO SUCH USER’S ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OR PROVISION OF SERVICES.</p>
          <p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE COVERAGE OF STRATIM’S INSURANCE POLICY AS DESCRIBED HEREIN OR ANY OTHER LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LIABILITY OF STRATIM AND ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE STRATIM PLATFORM, SERVICES, OR CONTENT EXCEED $1,000. THE ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN STRATIM AND YOU.</p>
          <h3 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>If Users enter into a Separate Agreement with STRATIM that describes the manner in which any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the STRATIM Platform, Services, or Content (collectively, <strong>“Disputes”</strong>), such Separate Agreement will govern the resolution of Disputes and will supersede this section titled “Dispute Resolution.”</p>
          <h4 id="disputes-between-you-and-a-third-party">Disputes between You and a Third Party</h4>
          <p>Because certain Services involve the utilization of third party facilities, in the event that you have a dispute with a third party in connection with the STRATIM Platform, STRATIM may, in its sole discretion, facilitate communication between you and the third party in connection with such dispute. If such a dispute is unable to be resolved between you and the third party, STRATIM may, in its sole discretion, and where feasible, intervene in such dispute and take any actions we deem appropriate.</p>
          <h4 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h4>
          <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
          <h4 id="agreement-to-arbitrate">Agreement to Arbitrate</h4>
          <p>You and STRATIM agree that any Disputes will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (b), an <strong>“IP Protection Action”</strong>). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. <strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and STRATIM are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and STRATIM otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
          <p>IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE WAIVER TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS, YOU MUST SEND A LETTER REQUESTING AN OPT OUT OF THE CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER, TO STRATIM AT 600 HARRISON STREET, #120, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 WITHIN 30 DAYS OF FIRST USING THE STRATIM PLATFORM OR ANY SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU SEND SUCH LETTER, IT WILL BE SENT TO STRATIM BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED.</p>
          <h4 id="arbitration-rules">Arbitration Rules</h4>
          <p><strong>The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures provided in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (excluding any Class Action Rules). (The JAMS Rules are available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/">www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/</a> or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</strong></p>
          <h4 id="arbitration-process">Arbitration Process</h4>
          <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules. (JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration Before JAMS at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf">http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf</a>.) The parties agree that the arbitration shall take place before one arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from JAMS’ roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 7 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules.</p>
          <h4 id="arbitration-location-and-procedure">Arbitration Location and Procedure</h4>
          <p>Unless you and STRATIM otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and STRATIM submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
          <h4 id="arbitrators-decision">Arbitrator’s Decision</h4>
          <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. STRATIM will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
          <h4 id="fees">Fees</h4>
          <p>Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, STRATIM will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
          <h4 id="changes-to-dispute-resolution-section">Changes to Dispute Resolution Section</h4>
          <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms and Conditions” section above, if STRATIM changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to info@stratim.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of STRATIM’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and STRATIM in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of STRATIM.
